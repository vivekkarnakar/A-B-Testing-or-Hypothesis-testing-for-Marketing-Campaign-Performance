# A-B-Testing-or-Hypothesis-testing-for-Marketing-Campaign-Performance

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the effectiveness of two marketing platforms—Facebook and AdWords—for the same campaign using A/B testing. To determine which platform drives more conversions, we applied the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric hypothesis test that compares conversion distributions without assuming normality. The findings help businesses optimize marketing budget allocation for higher ROI.

## 🔍 Objectives
Compare conversion performance between two marketing platforms (Facebook vs. AdWords)

Use A/B testing (hypothesis testing) to make data-driven decisions

Apply appropriate test in Python to analyze differences in conversion rates

Provide actionable insights to improve marketing strategy and budget allocation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Statistical Methods: A/B Testing, Mann-Whitney U Test
